Many activities can potentially contribute to the new community structure we seek to build. We're not quite sure in which direction this organization will evolve, but we'll be working towards it!

- Calls and “coffee hours” discuss to software-focused problems, share

- Code review
- Asynchronous collaboration on small tasks
- Encourage contributions to existing libraries
- Maintain a "task list" of ways that users can contribute
