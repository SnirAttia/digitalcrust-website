- Connect geoscientists who are solving problems by building software
- Encourage [[Code-level collaboration]] outside of organizational and funding-driven [[Development silos]]
- Support the development of [[Software libraries]] and shared code infrastructure
- _Open to the contributions_: Encourage contributions from many sources (e.g., enthusiast software professionals) to scientific software 

## Build [[Software literacy]]

- Build a shared vision of a digital crustal research.
- Teach geoscientists how to exist in a software-driven world

### Principles

  - _Broadly focused_: Teach broad skills and approaches, not specific languages
  - _Learn by doing_: Provide ways to contribute that allow students to get onboard and start helping



## Comparisons

We are similar in conception to some of our [[Aligned organizations]].

- Like EarthCube but from the bottom up (not a platform)
- Like Palaeoverse but for crustal science
- Like Software Underground but more focused on new software. Also a bit more centered within the academic community.
