Such a digital twin of the crust could provide a framework for all sorts of Earth systems research. Building such a digital twin of North America was the focus of the [original DigitalCrust effort](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/john-wesley-powell-center-for-analysis-and-synthesis/science/a-digital-crust-advance) and remains one of the main goals of this iteration.


# How does this work?

## Fuse observational records

- Geologic maps
- Stratigraphic columns
- Borehole measurements
- Geochemistry
- Geochronology
- Structural information

## Augment them with modeling

- 3D Geologic framework models
- Mineral physics/metamorphic evolution models
- Paleogeography
- Geodynamics/crustal thickness modeling

# Precursors

- Global Climate Models
