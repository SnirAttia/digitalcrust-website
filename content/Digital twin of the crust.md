A digital twin is a virtual representation of an object or system that spans its
lifecycle, is updated from real-time data, and uses simulation, machine learning
and reasoning to help decision making. _From IBM:

# How does this work?

## Fuse observational records

- Geologic maps
- Stratigraphic columns
- Borehole measurements
- Geochemistry
- Geochronology
- Structural information

## Augment them with modeling

- 3D Geologic framework models
- Mineral physics/metamorphic evolution models
- Paleogeography
- Geodynamics/crustal thickness modeling

# Precursors

- Global Climate Models
