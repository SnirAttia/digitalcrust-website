In addition to changing the structure of scientific fields, software can mediate
connections among them. Digital methods can provide new avenues for communication and collaboration.

Encoding the expertise of a field into a digital system enables other fields, _and non-experts_, to benefit from detailed scientific knowledge. Good software for science can help us escape isolated ivory towers and produce impactful research.

Software and data systems encapsulate parts of the geoscience research process.
