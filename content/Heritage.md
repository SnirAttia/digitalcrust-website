- The current iteration of DigitalCrust came out of this [Sparrow workshop](https://sparrow-data.org/media/2022/oct-workshop/index.html) in 2016
- The name, initial idea, and GitHub organization came out of this [collaborative project](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/john-wesley-powell-center-for-analysis-and-synthesis/science/a-digital-crust-advance) to understand crustal permeability at scale, which in turn draws on a long history of 3D crustal modeling

Came out of EarthCube. Observation that, while EarthCube funded good projects,
they were often siloed. Efforts to prevent this (e.g., compelling attendance to EarthCube-specific conferences; funding workshops) often were less effective than desired.

We lean on a broad community infrastructure for open-science software, formed
from many organizations [[Aligned organizations]].
