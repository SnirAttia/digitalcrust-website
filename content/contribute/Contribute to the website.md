# Contribute to the website

The DigitalCrust website is a repository that contains both code for rendering
the web page and the page content.

Pages are written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) with "wiki
links" to navigate between pages. This link structure can be navigated as a
graph using the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) app or the
[Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) extension for VS Code.

You will need to use Git and GitHub to contribute. But contributing to this
repository is a great way to learn!

Contributing media (images, videos, etc.) is a bit more complicated. It must be
uploaded to a S3 bucket and linked in pages.
