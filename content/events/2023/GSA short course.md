## Abstract

Increasingly, the future direction of geoscience depends on how we design and
use computational tools. A multiscale, time-integrated “digital crust” that can
be explored, visualized, and integrated into Earth system models is necessary
for future scientific work and requires sustained investment in software
infrastructure, data resources, and community practices. In this course, we will
introduce skills that can help researchers contribute to this vision. We will
cover foundational skills for sustainable digital systems, including software
design, GitHub collaboration, and database management. Furthermore, we will
examine how to integrate such work into a geological research career.
