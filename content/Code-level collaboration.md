We seek to integrate some of the approaches used for software development with geoscience research culture. Collaboration on code is a relatively recent, highly successful mode of collaborative production of digital infrastructure. It has resulted in important systems like Linux and most open-source software, produced by a global and _loosely-connected_ collaborative enterprise. While not everything produced by the technology industry is good, it has broken new ground on how to collaborate widely and quickly.

To make code-level collaboration feasible, we need to break work down into 
small constituent parts, for which collaborative work is less unwieldy.
Jointly maintained [[Software libraries]] provide one recipe for this.
