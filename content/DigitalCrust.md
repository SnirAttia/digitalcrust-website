# Goals

A community place to coordinate work on software infrastructure for geological
research.

- [[training]]: Teach skills for building software infrastructure to
  geoscientists.
- [[tech-transfer]]: Build links with the broader software community.

A way of thinking about geological research.

## Open foundations for the digital ecosystem in crustal geology

As geoscience research tasks get more complicated and rely on more digital data,
they must be supported by an ecosystem of high-quality, purpose-built software
tools to gather, fuse, analyze, and retain data. We need processes and
mechanisms to reduce duplicative work, focus effort in mutually beneficial
directions, and coalesce around standards and best practices. This requires
planning and coordination between organizations to solve shared problems.

## Software literacy and skills for research geologists

High-quality software systems for geology rely on a community of researchers
with the skills to build, maintain, and evaluate them. Many of the skills and
practices for this work, such as version control, shared libraries, and test-
and schema- driven development, have existed in the broader software field for
decades. These tools are underutilized in geoscience, often even by those who
create research software. By teaching skills in these areas, we can build better
collaborative practices (i.e., an ecosystem). Since the infrastructure of this
field is underdeveloped, there are ample opportunities for “learning on the job”
by contributing to shared libraries. Additionally, software expertise can
provide a pathway from geoscience into the broader technology field, creating
lucrative new pathways from a geoscience education.

# Approach

- [[coordination]]: Connect geoscientists who are solving problems by building
  software
  - [[Code-level collaboration]] melds the practices of software development
    with geoscience research
  - Work outside of organizational and funding-driven [[silos]]
- [[software-libraries]]: Promote and coordinate the development of shared code
  infrastructure

  - Teach broad skills, not specific languages
  - Provide ways to contribute for students/developers outside of science

- Building effective software is a mode of scientific collaboration:
  [[software-as-collaborative-science]].
- Building effective software is also a mode of scientific communication:
  [[software-as-communication]].

- [[software-systems]]: Most of us think of software as _scripts_, but we need
  to start thinking about _systems_.

# Heritage

- Came out of EarthCube. Observation that, while EarthCube funded good projects,
  they were often siloed. Efforts to prevent this (e.g., compelling attendance
  to EarthCube-specific conferences, and funding workshops) often were less
  effective than desired.
- Came out of the
  [Sparrow workshop](https://sparrow-data.org/media/2022/oct-workshop/index.html)
- Name and initial idea were a USGS–Macrostrat collaboration in 2016

We lean on a broad community infrastructure for open-science software, formed
from many organizations [[aligned-organizations]].
