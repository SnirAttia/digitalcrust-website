**DigitalCrust** is a community organization that coordinates work on software
infrastructure for geological research. It has several
[[DigitalCrust Goals|core goals]]:

- Establish practices of [[Code-level collaboration]] among geoscientists,
  encouraging
  - Software-driven connections among organizations and subfields
  - Modular, reusable [[Software libraries|software libraries]]
- Build [[Software literacy]] among geoscientists to enable these collaborative
  ties
- Work towards a [[Digital twin of the crust]] that integrates geological
  information across space and time

## [[People]]

DigitalCrust was created by geologists and informatics professionals who seek to
collaborate more closely across organizational bounds

## [[Motivation]]

Current collaborative and funding practices for geoinformatics research result
in [[Development silos|development silos]], competing platforms, and duplication
of effort between organizations. DigitalCrust advocates for lightweight
collaborative practices borrowed from the open-source software community to
improve community connectivity.

## [[Activities]]

DigitalCrust seeks to build coordination through low-overhead virtual meetings
and training and outreach events. It seeks to direct effort to many other
[[Aligned organizations]] that already support the geoscience software
ecosystem. As a loose collaborative enterprise, it remains open to new
initiatives in the future.
