## Open foundations for the digital ecosystem in crustal geology

As geoscience research tasks get more complicated and rely on more digital data,
they must be supported by an ecosystem of high-quality, purpose-built software
tools to gather, fuse, analyze, and retain data. We need processes and
mechanisms to reduce duplicative work, focus effort in mutually beneficial
directions, and coalesce around standards and best practices. This requires
planning and coordination between organizations to solve shared problems.

## Software literacy and skills for research geologists

High-quality software systems for geology rely on a community of researchers
with the skills to build, maintain, and evaluate them. Many of the skills and
practices for this work, such as version control, shared libraries, and test-
and schema- driven development, have existed in the broader software field for
decades. These tools are underutilized in geoscience, often even by those who
create research software. By teaching skills in these areas, we can build better
collaborative practices (i.e., an ecosystem). Since the infrastructure of this
field is underdeveloped, there are ample opportunities for “learning on the job”
by contributing to shared libraries. Additionally, software expertise can
provide a pathway from geoscience into the broader technology field, creating
lucrative new pathways from a geoscience education.

## Approach

[[How to contribute]]

## Goals

- Build [[Digital twin of the crust]]

- [[Foster communication]]
- [[Break down development silos]]
- [[Build software literacy among geoscientists]]

## Heritage

- Came out of EarthCube. Observation that, while EarthCube funded good projects,
  they were often siloed. Efforts to prevent this (e.g., compelling attendance
  to EarthCube-specific conferences, and funding workshops) often were less
  effective than desired.
- Came out of the
  [Sparrow workshop](https://sparrow-data.org/media/2022/oct-workshop/index.html)
- Name and initial idea were a USGS–Macrostrat collaboration in 2016

We lean on a broad community infrastructure for open-science software, formed
from many organizations [[Aligned organizations]].

## How to get involved

## Misc

- [[training]]: Teach skills for building software infrastructure to
  geoscientists.
- [[tech-transfer]]: Build links with the broader software community.

There is a long history of organizations that seek to coordinate digital
infrastructure in geology. Unlike previous efforts in the space, we seek to
foster lightweight collaboration, encouraging informal communication and shared
maintenance of small, reusable software libraries.

It seeks to build a lightweight "community of practice" that draws together
existing infrastructure, encouraging lightweight collaboration and shared
maintenance of small, reusable software libraries.
