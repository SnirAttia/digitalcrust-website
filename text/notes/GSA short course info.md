**Abstract:** Increasingly, the future direction of geoscience depends on how we design and use computational tools. A multiscale, time-integrated “digital crust” that can be explored, visualized, and integrated into Earth system models is necessary for future scientific work and requires sustained investment in software infrastructure, data resources, and community practices. In this course, we will introduce skills that can help researchers contribute to this vision. We will cover foundational skills for sustainable digital systems, including software design, GitHub collaboration, and database management. Furthermore, we will examine how to integrate such work into a geological research career. **Scholarships available, inquire at [daven@davenquinn.com](mailto:daven@davenquinn.com).**
