**DigitalCrust** is a community organization to coordinate work on software
infrastructure for geological research. It has several
[[DigitalCrust Goals|core goals]]:

- Establish practices of [[code-level collaboration]] among geoscientists,
  encouraging
  - [[Lightweight connections]] among organizations and subfields
  - Focus on modular, reusable [[Software libraries|software libraries]]
- Build [[Software literacy]] among geoscientists to enable these collaborative
  ties
- Work towards a [[Digital twin of the crust]] that integrates geological
  information across space and time

<div className="block">
## [[People]]

DigitalCrust was created by geologists and informatics professionals who seek to
collaborate more closely across organizational bounds

<div className="block">
## [[Motivation]]

Current collaborative and funding practices result in [[development silos]],
competing platforms, and duplication of effort between organizations.
DigitalCrust seeks to advocate for implementing lightweight collaborative
practices borrowed from the open-source software community

## [[Activities]]
DigitalCrust strives to be a [[Lightweight organization]], and currently seeks
to build coordination through virtual meetings and events for training and
outreach
</div>

<div className="block">
## [[Aligned efforts]]

There are many organizations working to build a capable and useful geoscience
software ecosystem. We seek to integrate with and direct effort to these
organizations.
