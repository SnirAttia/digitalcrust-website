- Software is critical to modern science
- Good software is hard to write, especially for geoscience

- Building effective software is a mode of scientific collaboration:
  [[software-as-collaborative-science]].
- Building effective software is also a mode of scientific communication:
  [[software-as-communication]].

- [[Research software systems]]
	- Systems for curating and representing scientific data
		- A lot of energy has gone into producing systems to curate data
			- [[PaleoBiology Database]]
			- [[Macrostrat]]
			- [[IEDA]]
			- [[Geochron.org]]
			- [[Sedimentary Geochemistry Project]]
			- [[MinDat]]
		- Some of these systems are widely used
		- Some of these systems are one-way stores
			- Difficult to get things out
			- We need to be able to _access_ geologic information in order to contribute to scientific goals 
		- Data systems are held back by the quality of their software
			- Representing, working with, and visualizing data
				- Lots of tools created _outside of_ geoscience for doing this types of work
				- 
			- Interchanging/fusing data
		-
	- [[The structure of software - applications, modules, and platforms]]

	- Most geoscientists think of software as _scripts_, but we need to start thinking about _systems_.
