- Software is critical to modern science
- Building effective software is a mode of scientific collaboration and communication
  [[software-as-collaborative-science]].
- Building effective software is difficult and requires expertise
- Such expertise must be built _within_ the sciences
- Scientists are the best positioned to write software for geoscience
- Software should be governed by the same collaborative energies (incremental updates, peer review) that animate the broader research community
- Collaborative, decentralized software infrastructure can enable new modes of geoscience research, such as a [[Digital twin of the crust]]
