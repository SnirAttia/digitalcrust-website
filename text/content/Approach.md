- [[Community coordination]]: Connect geoscientists who are solving problems by
  building software
- [[Code-level collaboration]] melds the practices of software development
    with geoscience research
  - Work outside of organizational and funding-driven [[Development silos]]
- [[Software libraries]]: Promote and coordinate the
  development of shared code infrastructure

  - Teach broad skills, not specific languages
  - Provide ways to contribute for students/developers outside of science

- Building effective software is a mode of scientific collaboration:
  [[software-as-collaborative-science]].
- Building effective software is also a mode of scientific communication:
  [[software-as-communication]].

- [[Research software systems]]: Most of us think of software as _scripts_, but
  we need to start thinking about _systems_.

- [[silos]]: Development silos
