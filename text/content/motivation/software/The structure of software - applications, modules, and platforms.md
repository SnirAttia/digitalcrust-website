## Applications

- "End-to-end" - encompass a whole proccess
- Familiar to users
- "Black boxes"

- There are many geoscience applications, often open ones
- We always need these!
- 
- To get exposure and usage from a broad spectrum of geoscientists, applications are need

## Modules

- Small/lightweight
- Smaller audience

Good modules are just as valuable as applications

- Many modules from _outside_ of geology
	- Many of these have seen significant contributions from geoscience
- Fewer from inside geology
- Changing this will be slow at first but will ultimately allow a flourishing of richer applications and platforms



## Platforms

- Like applications, they are end-to-end
- Run centrally and usable from everywhere
- Composed of modules
