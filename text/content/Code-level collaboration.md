Collaboration on code is a relatively recent, highly successful mode of collaborative production of digital infrastructure. It has resulted in important systems like Linux and most open-source software, produced by a global and _loosely-connected_ collaborative enterprise.

To make code-level collaboration feasible, we need to break work down into its
small constituent parts. Otherwise collaboration starts to get more unwieldy.
[[Software libraries]] are an important aspect of this.

Many [[Aligned organizations]] assist with building such systems.
