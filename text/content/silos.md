Silos arise when organizations don't have links or freedom to collaborate. This
can be due to funding or organizational priorities. A common refrain at
conferences is that "we should talk more," but in practice, it can be difficult.
Silos keep us fixed in non-collaborative patterns of work.

At the same time, silos serve a protective function: they are a mechanism to
guard priorities against external pressure and scope creep. To resist silos,
collaborative relationships must be focused on clear tasks.
[[Code-level collaboration]] is _lightweight_ and can easily adapt to changing
needs.
